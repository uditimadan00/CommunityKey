# Welcome to your CommunityKey app ðŸ‘‹

CommunityKey is a mobile application aimed at improving neighborhood security by facilitating communication and visitor management. The application will have two types of users: community members and security guards. Key features include user authentication, a notice board, a chatting feature, and visitor management. The members can choose to accept or deny the permission and the decision should go to the guard in real time. Also we can message and call other neighbours with the app

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
